The preparation method adopts medium-carbon steel and comprises the following steps: molten iron desulfurization, converter blowing, LF (ladle furnace) refining, RH vacuum refining, continuous casting, hot direct charging, soaking, rough rolling, finish rolling, laminar cooling, coiling, slow cooling and factory leaving. The steel 55MnB for domestic gardening tools has higher carbon content and excellent hardenability, avoids hardness nonuniformity and overlow hardness of the medium-carbon steel after heat treatment, and enhances the processing yield; and the steel 55MnB for domestic gardening tools has favorable hardenability.', 'The invention provides a gardening tool with multiple interchangeable tool heads, which includes a grip handle and a connecting head that is located at one end of the grip handle, wherein a plurality of fastening holes is provided at the front side and the lateral side of the connecting head. Besides, a specific tool can be provided at each of the two sides of the first tool head, whereas another specific tool can be provided at the front side of the second tool head. Despite that the tool head may be different, a connecting portion will be provided on each tool head, and a plurality of holes is provided on the connecting portion so that a plurality of fastening elements can be inserted into the holes to fix the connecting portion onto the front end or the side face of the connecting head. Thus, a plurality of tool heads is interchangeable for different usages by being assembled to and disassembled from the connecting head of the grip handle.', 'A garden tool is shown that has the compactness and general shape of a conventional straight shaft weeder. However, certain angles are formed in the shaft to facilitate easier use, particular by those with limited flexibility.', 'A motorized, hand-held garden cultivating tool having a novel assembly of parts for converting a first reciprocating motion to a second reciprocating motion at a substantial angle to the first. The conversion assembly includes a spring-connected linkage member and is free of bearings or any friction contact that would require protection from soil or grit.', 'A portable motorized device (1) for gardening tools having a crankcase (2), a motor (3) housed in the crankcase (2), a drive shaft (4) associated with the motor (4) and suitable for actuating a tool, control device (7) of the motor (3), where said crankcase (2) comprises two hollow substantially symmetrical portions (2 a , 2 b) divided vertically along a plane parallel to the rotation axis of the drive shaft (4), a grip (5; 55) with which control device (7) of the motor are associated.', 'A gardening tool is composed of a blade, a handle, and an eccentric rotating device connecting the blade and the handle. The blade has a connector provided with a receiving hole, whereas the handle is provided at one end thereof with a fastening hole. The eccentric rotating device is composed of a locating rod, a rotating rod and a bolt. The locating rod is securely received in the receiving hole of the connector of the blade while the rotating rod is fitted into the fastening hole of the handle.

Locking is assured in known manner by means of a leaf spring (14), the protuberance (18) of which engages in a locking hole of an inserted tool insertion pin. In order to loosen the coupling, the leaf spring (14) must be lifted out radially. This is done by means of a rocker arm (36) which acts on the free end (20) of the leaf spring (14) and in turn is actuated by axial displacement of a release button (22) which is displaceably mounted in the end of the handle. The restoring of the release button (22) is effected by the radial springing back of the leaf spring (14) which swings the rocker arm (36) back, which arm in turn exerts an axial force on the release button (22).', 'The utility model relates to a placing rack for gardening tools. The placing rack comprises a rectangular connecting frame and a placing box body, which are connected with each other; a plurality of connecting holes are formed in the connecting frame; a plurality of hooks are uniformly arranged on each of the left side end surface and the front side end surface of the placing box body; a napkin placing box is arranged on the right side of the placing box body; a cover plate is arranged on the upper side of the napkin placing box; one side of the cover plate is movably connected with the napkin placing box; a rectangular napkin outlet is formed in the front side of the napkin placing box. The placing rack has a simple structure, and is reasonable in design; the placing box body is arranged to be used for placing various required articles effectively, so that not only are articles are conveniently sought by workers, but also occupied space can be reduced; a fluorescent material layer is arranged, so that during use at night, articles are conveniently and quickly sought for by workers, and the working efficiency is improved.', 'An electrical gardening tool includes a working piece having a main body, and a seat body with a base seat. The main body includes a coupling strip with actuating and hook ends and a projection that is disposed within the main body, and a side wall with a slot. The base seat has a coupling end surface that is formed with a fixed bar to engage the hook end so as to fix the seat body to the working piece. The actuating end of the coupling strip is rotatable forcibly relative to the main body to turn the projection out of the main body through the slot so as to remove the hook end from the bar, thereby permitting removal of the seat body from the working piece.', 'A garden tool includes multiple of the following features: fishtail weeder/nail remover, trowel, nail remover, machete, saw, serrated blade, small-toothed saw, ergonomic handle, safety stop and attachment means for an elongated handle or cane. A rake attachment may also be attached to the elongated handle. The all-in-one tool: (i) saves space and money; (ii) is lightweight; (iii) minimizes the number of necessary tools; and (iv) is adjustable to accommodate user limitations (i.e., disabilities).', 'The handle is a standard wooden stick as used for a brush or a spade. A sleeve, ideally made of aluminum is pushed into the lower end of the stick. The sleeve can have slots and can be secured by spreading. A thin element made of a soft metal is accommodated within the sleeve exceeding this at the outer end. The pointed metal element is moved into a specific angle in relation to the stick by simultaneously bending the sleeve unit.', \"A multifunctional gardening tool that enables a user to mulch, weed and trim a garden, while also allowing the user to easily remove sod or grass using a single tool. The device comprises a handle, either hand held or elongated, along with a working end having a pentagonal shaped cutting tool. The gripping end of the handle is covered with a soft material to improve a user's grip, while the working end of the device comprises a cutting tool with a top portion that attaches to the handle, two parallel, vertical cutting edges and a protruding V-shaped blade constituting the bottom edges of the blade. Teeth on the V-shaped blade, in conjunction with the two vertical cutting edges of the blade, enable the device to cut through roots, sod and other obstacles typically encountered when working in a garden or yard.\", \"Handles allow hand tools, implements or other utensils to operate within their arc of natural use, motion and attack without requiring extension, flexion, radial deviation, or ulnar deviation of the wrist from the neutral plane of the forearm. The preferred embodiments further include a grip shaped to increase the effectiveness of the tool and minimize antagonism between muscles and tendons of the wrist, forearm and upper arm, while maximizing the effectiveness of the gripping force delivered to it by the user. Maintaining the wrist and forearm in a neutral position increases a tool user's potential strength by increasing the synergy between large muscles of the forearm and upper arm and shoulders. It also decreases compression of the tendons and nerves in the carpal tunnel and between the wrist and forearm. Grips according to the invention preferably conform in shape, diameter and dimensions to the physical architecture of the hand such that grip tension and compression of the tendons in the wrist and forearm is optimized, minimizing the compressive force on the small muscles, tendons, and ligaments of the fingers, hand, wrist, and forearm, while maximizing the contributive effectiveness of the larger muscles of the forearm, upper arm and shoulder.\", \"Handles allow hand tools, implements or other utensils to operate within their arc of natural use, motion and attack without requiring extension, flexion, radial deviation, or ulnar deviation of the wrist from the neutral plane of the forearm.
