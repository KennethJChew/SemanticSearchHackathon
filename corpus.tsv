Short-handled, ergonomic garden tools	english	Handles allow hand tools, implements or other utensils to operate within their arc of natural use, motion and attack without requiring extension, flexion, radial deviation, or ulnar deviation of the wrist from the neutral plane of the forearm. The preferred embodiments further include a grip shaped to increase the effectiveness of the tool and minimize antagonism between muscles and tendons of the wrist, forearm and upper arm, while maximizing the effectiveness of the gripping force delivered to it by the user. Maintaining the wrist and forearm in a neutral position increases a tool user's potential strength by increasing the synergy between large muscles of the forearm and upper arm and shoulders. It also decreases compression of the tendons and nerves in the carpal tunnel and between the wrist and forearm. Grips according to the invention preferably conform in shape, diameter and dimensions to the physical architecture of the hand such that grip tension and compression of the tendons in the wrist and forearm is optimized, minimizing the compressive force on the small muscles, tendons, and ligaments of the fingers, hand, wrist, and forearm, while maximizing the contributive effectiveness of the larger muscles of the forearm, upper arm and shoulder.	https://patents.google.com/patent/US8006351?oq=gardening+tools
Handle for household and gardening tools	english	A handle (10) is described which can be attached by means of a fastening coupling to gardening tools which have a corresponding complementary coupling. Locking is assured in known manner by means of a leaf spring (14), the protuberance (18) of which engages in a locking hole of an inserted tool insertion pin. In order to loosen the coupling, the leaf spring (14) must be lifted out radially. This is done by means of a rocker arm (36) which acts on the free end (20) of the leaf spring (14) and in turn is actuated by axial displacement of a release button (22) which is displaceably mounted in the end of the handle. The restoring of the release button (22) is effected by the radial springing back of the leaf spring (14) which swings the rocker arm (36) back, which arm in turn exerts an axial force on the release button (22).	https://patents.google.com/patent/US5809615?oq=gardening+tools
